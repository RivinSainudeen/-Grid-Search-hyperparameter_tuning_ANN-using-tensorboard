# -Grid-Search-hyperparameter_tuning_ANN-using-tensorboard
Uses tensorboard to visualize the results of grid search based hyperparameter tuning for a multi-layer(3 hidden layers) ANN(regression)
The results are analyzed in tensorboard.

Number of neurons and activation function in each hidden layer, optimizer are varied across specified range to find the optimum architecture.
